Computer Engineering student currently in the learning phase.

I am focusing on building a clear understanding of front-end fundamentals and core programming concepts. This profile is used mainly for practice, experimentation, and gradual improvement.

This GitHub profile reflects my learning journey. Projects here may be simple, incomplete, or experimental, and are part of the learning process.
